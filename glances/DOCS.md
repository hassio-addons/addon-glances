# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Glances

Glances is a cross-platform monitoring tool which aims to present a maximum of
information in a minimum of space through a Web-based interface.

Glances can export all system statistics to InfluxDB, allowing you to look
at all your system information and its behavior over time.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Search for the "Glances" add-on in the Supervisor add-on store
   and install it.
1. Disable "Protection mode" in the add-on panel.
1. Start the "Glances" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Glances" to see if everything went well.
1. Click the "OPEN WEB UI" button take a glance at Glances.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
process_info: false
refresh_time: 10
ssl: false
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
influxdb:
  enabled: false
  host: a0d7b954-influxdb
  port: 8086
  username: glances
  password: "!secret glances_influxdb_password"
  database: glances
  prefix: localhost
  interval: 60
  ssl: false
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `process_info`

If set to `true`, it will enable the process module of Glances and gives
detailed insight into each individual process running on the system.

**Note**: _Enabling this feature will increase CPU usage significantly._

### Options: `refresh_time`

Sets refresh time (in seconds).

**Note**: _Refreshing more quickly will result in a higher CPU usage._

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the Glances Web UI. Set it `true` to enable it,
`false` otherwise.

### Option: `certfile`

The certificate file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

### Option: `keyfile`

The private key file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

### Option group `influxdb`

---

The following options are for the option group: `influxdb`. These settings
only apply to the Glances InfluxDB data export.

#### Option `influxdb`: `enabled`

Enables/Disables the Glances data export to InfluxDB.

#### Option `influxdb`: `host`

The hostname where InfluxDB is running.

**Note**: _If you are using the Community InfluxDB add-on,
use `a0d7b954-influxdb` as the hostname._

#### Option `influxdb`: `port`

The port on which InfluxDB is listening.

#### Option `influxdb`: `username`

The username that you have created for Glances to authenticate against
InfluxDB.

#### Option `influxdb`: `password`

The password for the above username option.

#### Option `influxdb`: `database`

The name of the database to store all Glances information into.

**Note**: _It is strongly recommended to create a separate database for glances
and not store this in the same database name as Home Assistant._

#### Option `prefix`: `localhost`

The hostname to append for exported data.

**Note**: _For the Grafana Glances dashboard set this to `localhost`._

#### Option `influxdb`: `interval`

Defines the interval (in seconds) on how often Glances exports data to InfluxDB.

#### Option `influxdb`: `ssl`

Adding this option will allow SSL to be used on the InfluxDB connection. If not
set will default to `false` which is the required setting for the Community
InfluxDB add-on.

## Adding Glances as a sensor into Home Assistant

The Home Assistant Glances sensor platform is consuming the system information
provided by the Glances API.

This enables one to track and display their stats in Home Assistant,
and even build automations based on that data.

Set up the integration through **Configuration -> Integrations -> Glances**.

**Note**: _Once the add-on is running, add the integration with all
defaults, except for port, which should be 61209_

More information about the Glances sensor platform can be found in the
Home Assistant documentation:
